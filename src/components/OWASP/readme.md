## Authentication & Password Management:
Implement a secure authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users and utilize encryption, salting, etc., to store and manage your passwords securely. Some techniques mentioned by OWASP for this are:

Mandate authentication for all pages or resources that link to CIA Triad.
Stop password reuse and inform clients when password reset occurs.

## Session Management:
Securely address numerous requests from a web app service from diverse clients. Some points mentioned by OWASP for this are:

Ensure all connections and sessions end upon logout, and multiple logins are prohibited for the same User ID.
Minimize session inactivity timeout interval based on business and risk objectives.

## Access Control:
Enforce appropriate access control measures to grant or deny user access to systems or resources based on their privilege levels, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. Some techniques of access control mentioned by OWASP are given below:

Terminate inactive accounts.
Access to app data, secured URLs, services, attributes, etc., should only be granted to authorized users.

## Cryptographic Practices:
Employ cryptographic operations to encrypt sensitive data, ensuring that only authorized users can access and modify the data, thus maintaining data confidentiality. Some cryptographic approaches mentioned by OWASP for this are:

Utilize cryptographic key management.
Protect the Master key from unauthorized access.

## Error Handling & Logging:
Implement error-handling procedures to handle unsolicited output and employ logging to keep track of software/application changes and security-related events for auditing and monitoring purposes. Some logging and error-handling approaches are mentioned below:

Use error handlers that do not reveal debugging information in case of unsolicited input
Ensure that logs do not hold session or system information.

## Data Protection:
Enforce measures to guard paramount data from unauthorized alteration, compromise, or loss to ensure the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of the data. Some techniques to implement data protection are mentioned below:

Disable the auto-complete feature while entering data into forms.
Shield server-side code to deter unauthorized access.

## Communication Security:
Protect sensitive information during transmission using an SSL certificate issued by a trusted CA, along with distinct encryption variants. Some approaches mentioned by OWASP for this are:

Ensure that failed connections do not downgrade to unsecure protocols in case of SSL.
Designate character encoding for all connections.

## System Configuration:
Maintain computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state using configuration management tools. Some techniques mentioned by OWASP to achieve this are mentioned below:

Keep components updated with the latest version of security patches.
Isolate development and test environments from the production environment.
Database Security: Implement security measures to prevent various threats related to databases like SQL injection and data leakage. Some techniques to achieve this are mentioned below:

Change default passwords.
Enable multifactor authentication wherever applicable.

## File Management:
Construct an organized structure to store and retrieve information securely and easily. Some file management approaches mentioned by OWASP to achieve this are:

Organize by file types.
Nest folders within folders.
Review file headers to stop malicious (infected) uploads.
Disable execution privileges in directories where files are uploaded.
Avoid revealing absolute file paths to clients.

## Memory Management:
Mitigate vulnerabilities related to memory exploits (buffer overflows, memory leaks, etc.) that can lead to security breaches. Here are some techniques or approaches to achieve this:

Avoid vulnerable functions like strcat, print, etc.
Truncate input strings before employing functions like â€“ concatenation or copy.
